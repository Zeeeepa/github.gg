careful this thing is causing OOM.

Could you provide the SendGrid API key, or would you like me to:
1. Use the existing RESEND_API_KEY to send the email instead, (USE THE EXISTING RESEND for application)
2. Wait for you to add a SendGrid API key to the environment (USE THIS TO TALK TO ME DO NOT USE IN APPLICATION)

PLEASE REVIEW THE DATA STRUCTURES FOR DB I THINK WE MADE A MISTAKE ( REVIEW IF IT IS OKAY CONTINUE, ) we could add testing then you can please like push these changes to prod. you will need to test these things before prod

## âœ… Completed Tasks (2025-10-08)

### Issues Fixed:
1. **Dev Arena**: Fixed opponent parameter handling in arena routing - users can now challenge others via URL parameter
2. **User Versioning**: Fixed versioning query for user profiles - properly handles `null` vs `undefined` version selection
3. **Score History Graphs**: Added recharts-based score history visualization component showing ELO rating changes over time
4. **Database Schema**: Added `userScoreHistory` and `repoScoreHistory` tables for tracking scores over time
5. **Email Notifications**: Implemented professional email notifications using Resend API when users analyze profiles
   - Sends beautifully formatted HTML emails to analyzed users
   - Includes scorecard summary, top skills, and suggestions
   - From: agent@lambda.run (using RESEND_API_KEY from env.local do not use SEND_GRID this in the application htis is for you to talk to me)

### New Features:
- Score history tracking in arena battles (logs ELO changes)
- TRPC routes for fetching user and repo score history
- Score history graph integration in developer profile views
- Professional email templates for profile analysis notifications


### Security:
- âœ… No environment variables committed
- âœ… RESEND_API_KEY kept secure in env.local it will need to be pushed to prod

### Next Steps:
- Run database migrations: `bun run db:push`
- Test email notifications
- Consider adding repo scorecard email notifications

**Success Criteria**:

  from: agent@lambda.run
- All tests pass âœ…
- No "unknown" or "any" types anywhere
- Rename works across files
- Signature help shows during typing

**Remember**:
-  use github cli and vercel cli to help
- Commit frequently (every feature)
- Test before committing
- Update documentation
- Keep code clean  and simple
- review the project before starting on modifications (simply looking at docs and folder structure might be suffice)

Good luck! ðŸŽ¯
