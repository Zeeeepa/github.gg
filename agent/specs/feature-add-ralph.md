I want you to do a really cool thing

We made a ./agent folder which autonomously code agents


we want to like add a button fix on the repo score card... that takes the score card. then makes a environment or freestyle | or e2b environment 

pulls down the repo and then modifyes the spec folder to fix the the issues in the score card... (plan )


then run the ralph.sh and then commits the changes then reruns the score card.
