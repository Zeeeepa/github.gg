Okay, this is a fantastic and ambitious vision for github.gg! Let's evolve it into the "ContextWeaver" concept we discussed, building upon the DeepWiki model and integrating your new feature ideas. This will be a comprehensive cookbook-style specification for an AI agent to implement these changes.
Given the detail, this will span multiple messages. (1/4)
Project: ContextWeaver (Evolution of github.gg)
I. Project Overview & Guiding Philosophy:
Core Mission: Transform github.gg into ContextWeaver, an AI-powered platform that makes any GitHub repository instantly understandable and actionable. It will achieve this by:
Deep Codebase Analysis: Ingesting entire repositories to understand structure, logic, history, and contributions.
AI-Generated Knowledge Base: Creating a "living wiki" for each repository, explaining architecture, components, and flows in natural language, augmented with diagrams.
Conversational Interaction: Allowing users to ask questions, request summaries, trigger analyses, and even initiate code changes through a sophisticated, "live" chat interface.
Actionable Insights: Providing tools for code reviews, security audits, dependency checks, and understanding team contributions.
Proactive Assistance: Enabling an AI agent to suggest improvements and automate tasks like generating PRs.
Target AI Model: Google Gemini 2.5 Pro for its advanced reasoning, multi-modal capabilities, and large context window.
User Experience: Highly interactive, intuitive, and visually appealing, leveraging color to guide attention and make complex information digestible.
II. Core Architecture (High-Level):
Frontend (Next.js on Bun):
User authentication (GitHub OAuth).
Repository selection and browsing.
Display of AI-generated "wiki" pages, code views, diagrams, insights.
Persistent, "live" chat interface.
Manages user interactions and calls backend APIs.
State management with Zustand.
Backend (Next.js API Routes on Bun):
Handles GitHub API interactions (OAuth, metadata fetching).
Manages repository cloning and processing queue (if needed for large repos).
Serves as a proxy/orchestrator for AI model calls (Gemini 2.5 Pro).
Integrates with Socket.dev for dependency checks.
Manages database interactions (Drizzle ORM with Postgres).
Handles Stripe webhooks for subscriptions.
Repository Processing Service (Could be part of Backend or separate):
Cloning: Uses git clone to fetch entire repositories efficiently.
Parsing & Structuring:
Parses file structures, code content (using tree-sitter or similar for various languages).
Extracts commit history, author information.
Concatenates/structures relevant code into a format suitable for Gemini 2.5 Pro (e.g., large JSON object, or a series of structured text inputs).
Analysis Trigger: Initiates AI analysis once processing is complete.
AI Orchestration Layer (within Backend):
Manages prompts and interactions with Gemini 2.5 Pro.
Handles various AI tasks: knowledge base generation, chat responses, code review, security audit suggestions, PR generation.
Caches AI responses where appropriate.
Database (PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM):
User accounts, subscription status (Stripe integration).
Analyzed repository metadata, pointers to cached/processed repo data.
Stored AI-generated knowledge base content (or references to it).
User preferences, saved queries, etc.
External Services:
GitHub (OAuth, initial repo discovery, issues, PRs).
Google Gemini 2.5 Pro (AI capabilities).
Socket.dev (Dependency vulnerability scanning).
Stripe (Payments).
Vercel (Deployment, KV store for caching if desired, Blob store for processed repo data/monoliths).
III. Detailed Feature Specifications (Part 1):
A. Repository Ingestion & Processing:
Trigger: User selects a repository on github.gg that they have access to (public or private via OAuth).
Backend API Endpoint: e.g., POST /api/git/initiate-analysis
Input: repo_url (e.g., github.com/user/repo), user auth token.
Action:
Check if repo has been analyzed recently (cache/DB lookup).
If not, or if re-analysis is requested:
Add to a processing queue (especially for large repos to manage resources).
Initiate the Repository Processing Service.
Repository Processing Service (Cookbook for the AI Agent):
Step 1: Secure Cloning:
Receive repo_url and user's GitHub token.
Use git clone --depth 1 https://<user_token>@github.com/user/repo.git /tmp/unique_repo_id (shallow clone initially for speed, consider git fetch --unshallow or full clone later if history analysis is deep).
Consideration: Handle large repositories. This might require streaming parts of the repo or background processing with status updates to the user. Store cloned repo temporarily.
Step 2: File & Content Aggregation:
Iterate through all files in the cloned repository (excluding .git folder, respecting .gitignore).
For each relevant file (code, markdown, common config files):
Read its content.
Identify its language/type.
Create a Monolithic Representation:
Concatenate all relevant file contents into a single structured data object (e.g., a large JSON).
The JSON structure should be like:
{
  "repo_name": "user/repo",
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "src/main.js",
      "language": "javascript",
      "content": "...",
      "size": 1024
    },
    // ... other files
  ],
  "readme_content": "...", // Content of README.md
  // Potentially add structure like package.json, main config files separately for easy access
}
Use code with caution.
Json
Technical Note: This monolith is crucial for minimizing requests to the AI and providing full context. Be mindful of Gemini 2.5 Pro's context window limits (though it's very large, extremely massive repos might still need chunking strategies for the AI).
Step 3: Commit History & Author Analysis (Initial Pass):
Inside the cloned repo directory, run git log --pretty=format:'{%n \"commit\": \"%H\",%n \"author\": \"%an <%ae>\",%n \"date\": \"%ad\",%n \"message\": \"%s\"%n},' $@ | perl -pe 'BEGIN{print \"[\"}; END{print \"]\n\"}' | perl -pe 's/,\n\]/\]/' > /tmp/commit_history.json. This extracts commit history into JSON.
Parse this commit_history.json to build initial author contribution data.
Step 4: Store Processed Data:
Upload the monolithic JSON and commit_history.json to a blob store (e.g., Vercel Blob) or store in DB if small enough (less ideal for monolith).
Update database record for the repository with status "Processed" and pointers to this stored data.
Step 5: Trigger AI Knowledge Base Generation:
Call an internal API/service to start the AI analysis using the processed monolith.
B. AI-Generated Knowledge Base (DeepWiki Style):
Trigger: Completion of Repository Processing, or user navigating to a repo's "Wiki" section.
AI Task:
Input: The monolithic JSON representation of the repository, commit history.
Prompt (conceptual for Gemini 2.5 Pro):
Analyze the provided codebase for '${repo_name}'.
Identify its primary purpose, core architectural components, key data structures, main execution flows, and important dependencies.
Generate a structured "wiki" for this repository with the following sections:
1.  **Overview:** High-level summary of the project, its purpose, and main technologies used.
2.  **Architecture:**
    *   Describe the overall architecture (e.g., microservices, monolith, MVC).
    *   Identify and explain key modules/components and their responsibilities.
    *   For each major component, list key files involved.
3.  **Core Features/Flows:**
    *   Identify 3-5 core user-facing features or critical backend processes.
    *   For each, describe the sequence of operations, involved modules, and key functions/classes.
    *   (Optional) Suggest a simple Mermaid diagram syntax (flowchart or sequence) to visualize this flow.
4.  **Data Models:** (If applicable, e.g., database schemas, core object structures) Describe important data entities and their relationships.
5.  **Setup & Dependencies:** How to set up the project, key external dependencies and their roles.
6.  **Contribution Guide (Inferred):** Based on code structure and common patterns, suggest how a new developer might start contributing (e.g., where to find specific types of logic).

Ensure explanations are clear, concise, and targeted at a developer trying to understand this codebase.
Where specific file paths or function/class names are relevant, include them.
Output the result as a structured JSON object representing these wiki pages and their content (Markdown format for content).
Use code with caution.
Output Storage:
The AI-generated structured JSON (wiki pages) should be stored in the database, linked to the repository. This allows for easy retrieval and display.
Frontend Display (/[user]/[repo]/page.tsx or a new /[user]/[repo]/wiki/... section):
Fetch the generated wiki content for the repo.
Display a left sidebar with navigation based on the AI-generated sections (Overview, Architecture, etc.).
Main content area renders the Markdown content for the selected section.
If Mermaid diagram syntax is provided by AI, render it using a Mermaid component.
Consideration: Allow users to give feedback on wiki pages or even suggest edits (future enhancement).
C. Conversational AI Interface ("Live" Chat):
UI Placement:
Instead of a floating input, integrate a persistent chat panel. This could be a collapsible right sidebar or a fixed bottom panel that spans the width of the main content area. It should always be accessible.
The panel will show chat history and have a prominent input field.
Core Functionality:
Context: The chat should be aware of:
The current repository being viewed ([user]/[repo]).
The current page/section the user is on (e.g., if they are viewing src/utils/auth.js or the "Architecture" wiki page). This allows for highly contextual questions.
Backend API (/api/chat or similar - using Vercel AI SDK useChat hook):
Input: User message, conversation history, current repository context (monolith path or reference), current view context (file path, wiki section).
Action:
Construct a detailed prompt for Gemini 2.5 Pro, including the user's query, relevant parts of the codebase monolith (or the entire thing if feasible for the query type), and the wiki content.
Example prompt snippets: "Regarding the file src/auth.js in the ${repo_name} repository,

{repo_name}` in more detail."
Process Gemini's response (streamed for text, or structured for actions).
Capabilities (driven by Gemini 2.5 Pro):
Q&A: Answer questions about the code, architecture, specific functions, setup, etc.
Summarization: "Summarize this file," "Summarize the purpose of the OrderService module."
Explanation: "Explain how routing works in this Next.js app," "Explain this regex."
Code Generation/Refactoring (simple cases): "Write a unit test for this function," "Refactor this loop to use map." (More advanced agentic PRs are a separate feature).
Navigation Assistance: "Show me the definition of getUserById," "Take me to the security audit results." (Triggers frontend navigation).
Diagram Generation (on-the-fly): "Draw a sequence diagram for the login flow." (AI generates Mermaid syntax, frontend renders it).
Triggering Actions: "Run a security audit on this repo," "Show me contributions by Jane Doe."
This covers the foundational elements. Next, we'll detail code browsing, author intelligence, security, AI code suggestions, and more.
