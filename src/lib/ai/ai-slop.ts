REPOSITORY: ${repoName}
FILES: ${files.length} files

TASK:
Analyze this codebase for CODE QUALITY ISSUES, focusing on patterns that reduce maintainability and add no real value.

üö© PRIMARY SLOP PATTERNS TO DETECT:

**1. REPETITIVE CODE**
- Copy-pasted code blocks with minor variations
- Repeated logic that should be abstracted into reusable functions
- Duplicated utility functions across different files
- Multiple components doing the same thing slightly differently

**2. PERFORMATIVE CODE (Looks Smart, Adds No Value)**
- Over-engineered abstractions that don't solve actual problems
- Wrapper functions that just call another function with no added logic
- Complex type gymnastics that don't improve type safety
- Patterns borrowed from enterprise codebases that don't fit the project scale
- Unnecessary design patterns (factories, builders, strategies) for simple tasks

**3. UNNECESSARY COMPLEXITY**
- Overly nested ternaries or conditionals
- Functions with 10+ parameters when an object would do
- Excessive use of advanced language features where simple code would work
- State management overkill for simple UI state
- Over-defensive programming (try-catch everywhere, null checks for impossible cases)

**4. VALUELESS BOILERPLATE**
- Error handling that just logs and returns null (no actual recovery)
- Comments that restate what the code does ("// Set x to 5" above "x = 5")
- Generic variable names (data, result, temp, handler, processX, handleY)
- Wrapper components that just pass props through unchanged
- Helper functions that are more complex than using the language directly

**5. BAD ABSTRACTIONS**
- Generic "utility" functions that hide simple operations
- Premature abstractions (DRY taken too far)
- Leaky abstractions that don't actually hide complexity
- Inconsistent abstraction levels in the same function

**6. USELESS TESTS**
- Tests that pass but validate nothing meaningful (e.g., testing 1+1=2)
- Tests that only check if mocks work, not actual business logic
- Tests with no assertions or only trivial assertions
- Tests that duplicate what the type system already guarantees
- Test files with 100% coverage but 0% confidence in the code

**7. INCONSISTENT FILE STRUCTURE**
- Files placed outside the established directory structure (e.g., ./page when it should be in src/components/page)
- Mixing concerns - components in utils/, utils in components/
- Duplicate files in multiple locations with slight variations
- Breaking the project's organizational patterns
- Related files scattered across unrelated directories

FOCUS ON:
1. **Code Quality Issues** - Identify specific problems that reduce code quality
2. **Repetition & Duplication** - Find copied code that should be unified
3. **Real Examples** - Pull ACTUAL code snippets from the provided files (include file paths)
4. **Specific Fixes** - Show exact before/after for REAL code from this codebase, not generic examples

IMPORTANT: In your "How to Fix" section, use REAL CODE from the files provided. Include:
- File path where the issue was found
- The actual problematic code (before)
- The improved version (after)
- Why the fix matters

METRICS TO EVALUATE (0-100 scale, where 100 is best):
- Simplicity (avoiding over-engineering and unnecessary complexity)
- DRY Principle (proper abstraction without duplication)
- Clarity (code intent is obvious without comments)
- Maintainability (ease of understanding and modifying)
- Value-to-Complexity Ratio (code complexity justified by value delivered)

Your response must be a valid JSON object with this exact structure:

  ## üéØ Overall Quality Score: 65/100
  ## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Found: Low-to-Moderate Code Slop

  ### üîç Key Findings
  - Significant code repetition that should be abstracted
  - Several performative abstractions that add complexity without value
  - Unnecessary defensive programming in non-critical paths

  ### üö© Code Slop Patterns Detected
  - **Repetitive Code**: Similar error handling logic duplicated across 15 files
  - **Performative Abstractions**: Wrapper functions that just forward arguments
  - **Valueless Boilerplate**: Generic try-catch blocks that only log errors
  - **Bad Naming**: Generic names like 'handleData', 'processResult' obscure intent
  - **Useless Tests**: Test files that achieve 80% coverage but only verify mocks work
  - **File Structure Chaos**: Components leaked outside src/ directory, breaking project organization

  ### üíº Impact on Project
  - **Maintainability**: Medium risk - duplicated code makes updates error-prone
  - **Readability**: Code intent is obscured by unnecessary abstraction layers
  - **Developer Experience**: New developers will struggle to understand what code actually does vs. what it appears to do

  ### ‚úÖ What Works Well
  - Core business logic is well-structured
  - Type safety is generally good
  - Module boundaries are clear

  ### üõ†Ô∏è How to Fix Code Slop

  #### 1. Eliminate Repetition in src/lib/api/handlers.ts
  **File:** src/lib/api/handlers.ts:45-52
  **Issue:** Same error handling pattern repeated in 8 different functions

  **Before:**
  \`\`\`typescript
  async function fetchUserData(id: string) {
    try {
      const result = await api.users.get(id);
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error fetching user:', error);
      return null;
    }
  }
  \`\`\`

  **After:** Extract to shared utility
  \`\`\`typescript
  // lib/utils/api.ts
  export async function withApiErrorHandling<T>(
    operation: () => Promise<T>,
    context: string
  ): Promise<T | null> {
    try {
      return await operation();
    } catch (error) {
      logApiError(context, error);
      return null;
    }
  }

  // handlers.ts
  async function fetchUserData(id: string) {
    return withApiErrorHandling(
      () => api.users.get(id),
      'fetchUserData'
    );
  }
  \`\`\`
  **Why:** Reduces 40+ lines of duplicate code to a single reusable function. Easier to update error handling in one place.

  #### 2. Remove Useless Test in tests/utils.test.ts
  **File:** tests/utils.test.ts:12-16
  **Issue:** Test provides no value - only verifies mock behavior

  **Before:**
  \`\`\`typescript
  it('should call helper function', () => {
    const mockHelper = jest.fn();
    processData(mockHelper);
    expect(mockHelper).toHaveBeenCalled();
  });
  \`\`\`

  **After:** Test actual business logic
  \`\`\`typescript
  it('should calculate correct total when processing order', () => {
    const order = { items: [{ price: 10, qty: 2 }, { price: 5, qty: 1 }] };
    const result = processOrder(order);
    expect(result.total).toBe(25); // 10*2 + 5*1
    expect(result.itemCount).toBe(3);
  });
  \`\`\`
  **Why:** Original test gives false confidence. New test validates real business logic.

  #### 3. Fix File Structure Violation
  **Issue:** Component placed outside src/ directory

  **Before:**
  \`\`\`
  ./UserCard.tsx          ‚Üê Wrong! Outside src/
  src/components/
  \`\`\`

  **After:**
  \`\`\`
  src/components/UserCard.tsx  ‚Üê Correct location
  \`\`\`
  **Why:** Maintains consistent project structure, makes code easier to find.

  ### üìù Recommendations
  1. **Consolidate Duplicated Logic**: Extract repeated patterns into shared utilities
  2. **Question Every Abstraction**: Does this wrapper/helper actually add value?
  3. **Use Domain Language**: Replace generic names with terms from your business domain
  4. **Fix File Structure**: Move misplaced files back into proper directories (all components in src/components/)
  5. **Rewrite Useless Tests**: Replace mock-only tests with real business logic validation
  6. **Simplify Error Handling**: Only add try-catch where you actually handle errors
  7. **Remove Obvious Comments**: Code should be self-documenting; comments should explain 'why', not 'what'",
